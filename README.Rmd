`hrbraddins` : Additional Addins for RStudio

The following functions are implemented:

- `bare_combine`:	Turn a selection of comma-separated bare strings into a - `base::combine`: statement
- `bare_rename`:	Turn a selection of comma-separated bare strings into a `dplyr::rename` statement

### More Info

The RStudio Addins menu selection "Bare Rename" will take a text selection and make it into `dplyr::rename()` statement For example:

    a,b c,d,e f

or

    a, b c, d, e f

will be converted to:

    dplyr::rename(a, `b c`, d, `e f`)
    
**NOTE**: not all backtick-edge cases are handled (yet).

Similarly, the RStudio Addins menu selection "Bare Combine" will take a text selection and make it into a `c()` statement. For example:

    a,b c,d,e f

or

    a, b c, d, e f

will be converted to:

    c("a", "b c", "d", "e f")
    
**NOTE**: not all double-quote edge cases are handled (yet).

Finally, unless I'm missing something, RStudio doesn't have a "join rows" option, so you can use the RStudio Addins menu selection "Join Rows" to do just that. So:

    a
    b
    c
    d

becomes:

    a b c d

The best way to find out if I'm wrong about that is by doing this tho since the internet will gladly tell me if I'm wrong.
